# LinkedIn-Data

Theattached viz is a product of 534 LinkedIn search results where up-to-the-minute elapsed time and # of applicants were available. Within the 534 results there were a total of 81 unique opportunities. Each of the 534 results offered a unique expression of elapsed time vs. # of applicants

Without more data I cannot make any solid conclusions, however, in this case April 5 - MONDAY, had the highest number of applicants per hour.
